Loop Olympics 
====================

This Loop Olympics folder contains various loops to solve for different problems. We were required to take arrays and print thme in a specified order. In addition to this we were to take arrays with specific items in the array and output the data in a different order. The last task was to create a for loop within a loop to output a grid of different items.
