Terminal Practice  
====================

This is the main README file for the Terminal Practice exercise completed in class. The goal of the terminal practice was to get comfortable using various commands to edit and add folders and files via the terminal. In addition to this we were asked to create a very simple webpage that displays "hello world" by using JavaScript.
