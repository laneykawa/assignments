Loops and Arrays Practice
====================

Is folder contains an exercise thatl oops through an array and counts the number of the word "computer". The second loop goes through tos ee if someone is old enough to see Mad Max Fury Road. I used an if statement to find the matches when looping through and then pushed this into a new array. From there I used array length to count the number of "computer".
