Function Exercies 
====================

We wrote a funtion with two parameters tha provides the sum. Then returns the higher number of the two. Then we wrote a function that accepts a parameter and returns odd or even. To do this I created an if statement to statement to check if the number divided by 2 was 0. If so then ti was even if else it was odd. I thenk learned how to take the string and concatonate the results if it satisfied a certain length. If it was longer then the specific lenth we spliced that.
