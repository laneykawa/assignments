Silly CIA Exercise  
====================

This is the main README file for the Silly CIA Exercise 1 & 2. 

The first objective or part 1 was to set up a basic html page. We needed to ensure the document type, set language, add header and body, and add tags for different elements. Some examples of what we inserted are unorganized lists, images, and bold font with html code (not yet css).

The second objective or part 2 was to then create a styles.css file to give a new look to our page according to the outlined instructions. In addition to this we had to link the .html page with the .css page.
