Color Grid From Scratch  
====================

We used css to create an indential color grid with 4 rows and 5 colors. The first line was 100% of the width, the second was four sections of hot pink, the third was two sections of blue, and last was green 2/3 of the way and orange the rest. All of these have a white border and are located in the middle of the page.
