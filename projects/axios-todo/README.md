Todo Axios  
====================

This is a todo application where you can add in your todos, checkoff, and delete when completed. 

In this code you will see the functions below: 

1) Post request for new todos
2) Get request for existing todos
3) Put request to edit or add the image url for the todo
4) Delete request to remove todo from list

In addition to the axios functions above, to push this information to the DOM there are several supporting functions. 

1) Add to DOM
2) Submit event listener
3) Delete button event listener
4) Checkbox change
5) Image input change event listener

As each new element is created, this is pushed into a list in the DOM. 

Important Variables:
data = object with data
url = api url
